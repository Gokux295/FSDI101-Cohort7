<H3>My life in 2 parts</H3>
<li><b>Part 1</b> </li>
<P>I was born in minneapolis in april of 1986. Grew up in a town of coon rapids until i was 14. My family then moved to Janesville, Wisconsin.  I lived there until i was 18 when i went to the Univeristy of Minnesota. 
    After a year of School at the U of MN i decided to join the MN National Guard.  So for the next 9 months i was in military training with basic training and then your MOS school (25B).   Upon my return i re-enrolled in school until the winter of 2009 when my unit was activated for deployment in Febuary of 2009 we deployed for Basara, Iraq for a year.  again upon my return i enrolled in the U of mn to complete my bachelors degree.  Upon graduation I was given the opportunity to be apart of the Honor Guard for the MN National Guard.  i performed that job for a 2 years and then i was looking for outside of the MN National Guard. I got my first
job at a IT Help Desk at United Health Group. I was able to work my up to IT systems consultant and then i moved firms to Amerprise Finacial inc where i am now an IT operations Manager.</P>
